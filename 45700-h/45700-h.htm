<p>Nothing is more calculated to give Englishmen a good
conceit of themselves in the matter of international courtesy
than a careful examination of the archives of Mr. Punch,
such as was necessary in the preparation of the present
volume. To anyone familiar with the anti-British attitude
of the French comic press before these happier days of the
<i>Entente Cordiale</i>, and of the German press at all times, the complete
absence of all manner of ill-feeling from Mr. Punch's
jokes about our neighbours across the Channel is little short
of wonderful. Even in the days when the English people were
the unfailing subject for every French satirist when he suffered
from an unusual attack of spleen, our national jester seems never to
have lost the good-humour with which he has usually surveyed
the life of the Continent. Indeed, as the pages here brought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
together will readily prove, Mr. Punch has seldom, if ever,
laid himself open to the charge of insularity in his point of
view. Instead of showing a tendency to ridicule our neighbours
on the Continent, he has been more inclined to pillory
the follies of his own countrymen, and to contrast their
behaviour on the Continent rather unfavourably with that of the natives.
But, even so, there is nothing in these humorous chronicles of "Mr. Punch
on the Continong" which will not amuse equally the travelling or the stay-at-home
Briton and the foreigner, since each will find many of his national
characteristics "touched off" in a way that is no less kindly than amusing.
The fact that a considerable proportion of these pages are from the pen
of George Du Maurier, himself a Frenchman by birth, is a reminder that
long before the Governments of France and Great Britain had come
into their present relationship of intimate friendliness, Mr. Punch had
maintained his own <i>Entente Cordiale</i>!</p>

<h2 class="ch">BREAKING THE BANK AT MONTE CARLO</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>A Note from One who has all but done it</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</span>.&mdash;Now that so many of my
countrymen (the word includes both sexes)
patronise Monte Carlo, it is well that they should
be provided with an infallible system. Some
people think that a lucky pig charm or a piece of
Newgate rope produces luck. But this impression
is caused by a feeling of superstition&mdash;neither
more nor less. What one wants in front of the
table is a really scientific mathematical system.
This I am prepared to give.</p>

<p>Take a Napoleon as a unit, making up your
mind to lose up to a certain sum, and do not
exceed that sum. Now back the colour twenty
consecutive times. Don't double, but simply keep
to the unit. When you have lost to the full extent
of your limit, double your stake. Keep to this
sum for another twenty turns. By this time it is
a mathematical certainty that you must either
have won&mdash;or lost. Of course, if you have won
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
you will be pleased. If you have lost, keep up
your heart and double your stakes again. This
time you will be backing the colour with a stake
four times as large as your original fancy. Again
go for twenty turns, and see what comes of it.</p>

<p>Of course, if you still lose it will be unfortunate,
but you cannot have everything. And with this
truism, I sign myself,</p>

<p class="author"><span class="sc">One who wishes to Benefit Mankind</span>.</p>

<h2 class="ch">A ROMAN HOLIDAY</h2>

<p class="titleit">On the Appian Way</p>

<p>We are with a guide, voluble after the fashion
of guides all the world over, and capable of speaking
many languages execrably. His English, no
doubt, is typical of the rest. "Datt-e building
dere," he says, "is de Barze of Caracalla."</p>

<p>"The <i>what</i>?" says my companion.</p>

<p>"De Barze of Caracalla&mdash;vere de ancient
Romans bayze demselfs in de water&mdash;same as ve
go to Casino, zey take a barze, morning, afternoon,
ven zey like."</p>

<p>"It must have been a large building," I venture,
ineptly.</p>

<p>"In dem dere barze," he retorts, impressively,
"sixteen honderd peoples all could chomp in de
water same time!"</p>

<p>"Jolly good splash they must have made,"
says A.</p>

<p>The guide pays no attention, but continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dem dere barze not de biggest. In de Barze
of Diocletian four tousand peoples all could chomp
in de water same time. In all de barze in Rome
forrrty tousand could chomp in same time."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span></p>

<p>"I wonder," says A., "how they got 'em all
together and started them jumping?"</p>

<p>"Vell, dey not all chomp togesser every day
same peoples, but ven de barze all full den forrrty
tousand chomp in same time."</p>

<p class="titleit">At the Bosco Sacro.</p>

<p>"Now," remarks the guide, "I tell you fonny
story&mdash;make you laugh. Ven dem eight honderd
robbers foundated Rome dey live on a 'ill and dey
haf no religion. Den come de King Numa Pompilio:
he say 'dey most haf religion,' so he can
goffern dem better. Den 'e go to diss <i>bosco</i>, and
ven he come back he tell dem robbers he haf seen
de Naimp <i>Egeea</i>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The Nymph <i>Egeria</i>," A. intervenes, with
superiority.</p>

<p>"Vell, I say de Naimp <i>Egeea</i>. He say he haf
seen her, dat she haf appareeted to him, and so
dey get deir religion."</p>

<p>A. laughs dubiously.</p>

<p>"Yes," concludes the guide, "dat iss a fonny
story."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span></p>

<p class="titleit">By the Circus of Maxentius.</p>

<p>"Diss is de Circus of Massenzio. He build 'im
ven his son Romulus die. No, diss is not de same
Romulus who foundated Rome, but anosser one, a
leetle boy, de son of de Emperor Massenzio. He
die ven he vos a leetle boy. In dem days it not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
permitted to make sacrifice of men, so dey build
a race-course instead: it is de same ting, for
some of de charioteers alvays get dem killed, and
Massenzio tink dey go play wiz Romulus."</p>

<p class="titleit">In the Catacombs.</p>

<p>"Ven de <i>martiri</i> condemnated to dess and dey
kill dem, dey safe some drops blood in a leetle
bottle and dey put dem bottles in de valls. Dere
iss a bit, you see. San Sebastiano 'e vos condemnated
to de arrows&mdash;dey shotted 'im&mdash;and afterward
dey smash his head on a column. Dere is
de column."</p>

<p>"What was that you were telling us about Caracalla
just now?"</p>

<p>"Caracalla he no like 'is brozzer Geta&mdash;so he
kill 'im. Den he make 'im a god and tell peoples
to vorship him, and 'e say 'I did not like my
brozzer ven he vos a man, but I like him very

<h2 class="ch">WONDERS OF THE WORLD ABROAD</h2>

<p>Wonder if there be an inn upon the Continent
where you are furnished gratis with a cake of soap
and bed candle.</p>

<p>Wonder how many able-bodied English waiters
it would take to do the daily work of half a dozen
French ones.</p>

<p>Wonder why it is that Great (and Little) Britons
are so constantly heard grumbling at the half a
score of dishes in a foreign bill of fare, while at
home they have so frequently to feed upon cold
mutton.</p>

<p>Wonder what amount of beer a German tourist
daily drinks, and how many half-pint glasses a
waiter at Vienna can carry at a time without
spilling a drop out of them.</p>

<p>Wonder how it is that, although one knows full
well that many Paris people are most miserably
poor, one never sees such ragged scarecrows in its
streets as are visible in London.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Wonder how many successive ages must elapse
ere travellers abroad enjoy the luxury of salt-spoons.</p>

<p>Wonder why so many tourists, and particularly
ladies, will persist in speaking French, with a true
Britannic accent, when the waiter so considerately
answers them in English.</p>

<p>Wonder when our foreign friends, who are in
most things so ingenious, will direct their ingenuity
to the art of drainage coupled with deodorising
fluids.</p>

<p>Wonder if there be a watering-place in France
where there is no Casino, and where Frenchmen
may be seen engaged in any game more active
than dominoes or billiards.</p>

<p>Wonder when it will be possible to get through
seven courses at a foreign <i>table d'hôte</i> without
running any risk of seeing one's fair neighbour
either eating with her knife or wiping her plate
clean by sopping bread into the gravy.</p>

<p>Wonder what would be the yearly increase of
deafness in Great Britain, if our horses all had
bells to jangle on their harness, and our drivers all
were seized with the mania for whip-cracking,
which possesses in such fury all the coachmen on
the Continent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span></p>

<p>Wonder in what century the historian will relate
that a Frenchman was seen walking in the country
for amusement.</p>

<p>Wonder why it is that when one calls a Paris
waiter, he always answers, "V'la, M'sieu," and then
invariably vanishes.</p>

<p>Wonder when Swiss tourists will abstain from
buying alpenstocks which they don't know how to
use, and which are branded with the names of
mountains they would never dare to dream of
trying to do more than timidly look up to.</p>

<p>Wonder in what age of progress a sponge-bath
will be readily obtainable abroad, in places
most remote, and where Britons least do congregate.</p>

<p>Wonder if French ladies, who are as elegant in
their manners as they are in their millinery, will
ever acquire the habit of eating with their lips
shut.</p>

<p>Wonder when it will be possible to travel on the
Rhine, without hearing feeble jokelets made about
the "rhino."</p>

<h2 class="ch">AN IDYLLIC ISLAND</h2>

<p>When we came to Amsterdam, we determined,
Pashley, Shirtliff and I, that we would take the
earliest opportunity of seeing Marken. Wonderful
place, by all accounts. Little island, only two
miles from mainland, full of absolutely unsophisticated
inhabitants. Most of them have never left
Marken&mdash;no idea of the world beyond it! Everybody
contented and equal; costumes quaint;
manners simple and dignified. Sort of Arcadia,
with dash of Utopia.</p>

<p>And here we are&mdash;actually at Marken, just
landed by sailing-boat from Monnickendam.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span></p>

<p>All is peaceful and picturesque. Scattered
groups of little black cottages with scarlet roofs,
on mounds. Fishermen strolling about in baggy
black knickerbockers, woollen stockings, and
wooden shoes.</p>

<p>Women and girls all dressed alike, in crimson
bodice and embroidered skirt; little cap with one
long brown curl dangling coquettishly in front of
each ear. Small children&mdash;miniature replicas of
their elders&mdash;wander lovingly, hand in hand. A
few urchins dart off at our approach, like startled
fawns, and disappear amongst the cottages.
Otherwise, our arrival attracts no attention.</p>

<p>The women go on with their outdoor work,
cleaning their brilliant brass and copper, washing
and hanging out their bright-hued cotton and linen
garments, with no more than an occasional shy
side-glance at us from under their tow-coloured
fringes. "Perfectly unconscious," as Shirtliff
observes, enthusiastically, "of how unique and
picturesque they are!"</p>

<p>All the more wonderful, because excursion
steamers run every day during the season from
Amsterdam.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span></p>

<p>We walk up and down rough steps and along
narrow, winding alleys. Shirtliff says he "feels
such a bounder, going about staring at everything
as if he was at Earl's Court." Thinks the
Markeners must hate being treated like a show.
<i>We</i> shouldn't like it ourselves!</p>

<p>That may be, but, as Pashley retorts, it's the
Markeners' own fault. They shouldn't be so
beastly picturesque.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/i_031-800.png"><img src="images/i_031-200.png" width="200" height="366" alt="Little Toddlekins" /></a></div>

<p>Fine buxom girl approaches, carrying pail. On
closer view, not precisely a girl&mdash;in fact, a matron
of mature years. These long, brown side-curls
deceptive at a distance; impression, as she passes,
of a kind of Dutch "Little Toddlekins"; view of
broad back and extensive tract of fat, bare neck
under small cap. She turns round and intimates
by expressive pantomime that her cottage is close
by, and if we would care to inspect the interior,
we are heartily welcome. Uncommonly friendly
of her. Pashley and I are inclined to accept, but
Shirtliff dubious&mdash;we may have misunderstood
her. We really can't go crowding in like a parcel
of trippers!</p>

<p>Little Toddlekins, however, quite keen about it;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>
sees us hesitate, puts down pail and beckons us on
round corner with crooked forefinger, like an
elderly Siren. How different this simple, hearty
hospitality from the sort of reception foreigners
would get from an English fishwife! We can't
refuse, or we shall hurt her feelings. "But
whatever we do," urges Shirtliff, "we mustn't
dream of offering her money. She'd be most
tremendously insulted."</p>

<p>Of course, we quite understand <i>that</i>. It
would be simply an outrage. We uncover, and
enter, apologetically. Inside,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>
an elderly fisherman is sitting by the hearth mending
a net; a girl is leaning in graceful, negligent
attitude against table by window. Neither of them
takes the slightest notice of us, which is embarrassing.
Afraid we really <i>are</i> intruding. However, our
hostess&mdash;good old soul&mdash;has a natural tact and
kindliness that soon put us at our ease. Shows us
everything. Curtained recesses in wall, where they
go to bed. "Very curious&mdash;so comfortable!" Delft
plates and painted shelves and cupboards. "Most
decorative!" Caps and bodices worn by females
of the family. "Charming; such artistic colour!"
School copybooks with children's exercises.
"Capital; so neatly written!" What is she trying
to make us understand? Oh, in winter, the
sea comes in above the level of the wainscot.
"Really! How very convenient!" We don't
mean this, but we are so anxious to please and be
pleased, that our enthusiasm is degenerating into
drivel. Girl by the window contemplates us with
growing contempt; and no wonder. High time
we went.</p>

<p>Little Toddlekins at the end of her tether;
looks at us as if to imply that she has done <i>her</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>
part. Next move must come from us. Pashley
consults us in an undertone. "Perhaps, after all
she <i>does</i> expect, eh? What do <i>we</i> think? Would
half a gulden&mdash;&mdash; What?"</p>

<p>Personally, I think it <i>might</i>, but Shirtliff won't
hear of it, "Certainly not. On no account!
At all events <i>he</i>'ll be no party to it. He will
simply thank her, shake hands, and walk out."
Which he does. I do the same. He may be
right, and anyhow, if one of us is to run the risk
of offending this matron's delicacy by the offer
of a gratuity, Pashley will do it better than I.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/i_033-1200.png"><img src="images/i_033-600.png" width="600" height="432" alt="It appears that we have not paid the baby,..." /></a></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span></p>
<p>Pashley overtakes us presently, looking distinctly
uncomfortable. "Did he tip her?" "Yes, he <i>tipped</i>
her." "And she flung it after you!" cries Shirtliff,
in triumph. "I knew she would! <i>Now</i> I hope
you're satisfied!"</p>

<p>"If I am, it's more than <i>she</i> was," says Pashley.
"She stuck to it all right, but she let me see it was
nothing like what she'd expected for the three
of us."</p>

<p>Shirtliff silent but unconvinced. However, as
we go on, we see a beckoning forefinger at almost
every door and window. Every Markener anxious
that we should walk into his little parlour&mdash;and pay
for the privilege. All of them, as Pashley disgustedly
observes, "On the make"; got some
treasured heirloom that has been in the family
without intermission for six months, and that they
would be willing to part with, if pressed, for a
consideration. We don't press them; in fact, we
are obliged at last to decline their artless invitations&mdash;to
their unconcealed disgust. Nice people,
very, but can't afford to know too many of them.</p>

<p>"At least the <i>children</i> are unspoilt," says Shirtliff,
as we come upon a couple of chubby infants,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg 36]</span>
walking solemnly hand in hand as usual. He
protests, when Pashley insists on presenting them
with a cent, or one-fifth of an English penny,
apiece. "Why demoralise them, why instil the
love of money into their innocent minds?" Shirtliff
wants to know.</p>

<p>He is delighted when they exhibit no sort of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>
emotion on being thus enriched. It shows, he
says, that, as yet, they have no conception what
money means.</p>

<p>The pair have toddled off towards a gathering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>
of older children, and Pashley, who has brought a
Kodak, wonders if he can induce them to stay as
they are while he takes a snapshot. Shirtliff
protests again. Only spoil them, make them
conceited and self-conscious, he maintains.</p>

<p>But the children have seen the Kodak, and are
eager to be taken. One of them produces a baby
from neighbouring cottage, and they arrange themselves
instinctively in effective group by a fence.</p>

<p>Pashley delighted. "Awfully intelligent little
beggars!" he says. "They seem to know exactly
what I want."</p>

<p>They also know exactly what <i>they</i> want, for the
moment they hear the camera click, they make a
rush at us, sternly demanding five cents a head
for their services.</p>

<p>Shirtliff very severe with them; not one copper
shall they have from <i>him</i>; not a matter of pence,
but principle, and they had better go away at
once. They don't; they hustle him, and some of
the taller girls nudge him viciously in the ribs
with sharp elbows, as a hint that "an immediate
settlement is requested." Pashley and I do the

No; Marken infantry still harassing our rear.
What <i>more</i> do they want? It appears that we
have not paid the baby, which is an important
extra on these occasions, and which they carry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
after us in state as an unsatisfied creditor and a
powerful appeal to our consciences. Adult
Markeners come out, and seem to be exchanging
remarks (with especial reference to Shirtliff, who is
regarded as the chief culprit) on the meanness
that is capable of bilking an innocent baby.</p>

<p>"What I like about Marken," says Pashley,
when we are safely on board our sailing boat, to
which we have effected a rather ignominious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
retreat, "what I like about Marken is the beautiful
simplicity and unworldliness of the natives.
Didn't that strike <i>you</i>, Shirtliff?"</p>

<p>We gather from Shirtliff's reply that he failed to
observe these characteristics.</p>

<h2>THE DAMSELS OF DIEPPE</h2>

<p class="titleit">Or, The Legend of Lionel</p>

<div class="poem width33">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Newhaven to Dieppe," he cried, but, on the voyage there,</p>
<p>He felt appalling qualms of what the French call <i>mal de mer</i>;</p>
<p>While, when the steward was not near, he struck Byronic attitudes,</p>
<p>And made himself most popular by pretty little platitudes.</p>
<p class="i2">And, while he wobbled on the waves, be sure they never slep',</p>
<p class="i2">While waiting for their Lionel, the Damsels of Dieppe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span></p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He landed with a jaunty air, but feeling rather weak,</p>
<p>While all the French and English girls cried out "<i>C'est magnifique!</i>"</p>
<p>They reck'd not of his bilious hue, but murmur'd quite ecstatical,</p>
<p>"Blue coat, brass buttons, and straw hat&mdash;c'est <i>tout-à-fait</i> piratical!"</p>
<p class="i2">He hadn't got his land-legs, and he walked with faltering step,</p>
<p class="i2">But still they thought it <i>comme-il-faut</i>, those Damsels of Dieppe.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>The Douane found him circled round by all the fairest fair,</p>
<p>The while he said, in lofty tones, he'd nothing to declare;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span></p>
<p>He turned to one girl who stood near, and softly whisper'd "Fly, O Nell!"</p>
<p>But all the others wildly cried, "Give us a chance, O Lionel!"</p>
<p class="i2">And thus he came to shore from all the woes of Father Nep.,</p>
<p class="i2">With fatal fascinations for the Damsels of Dieppe.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>He went to the Casino, whither mostly people go,</p>
<p>And lost his tin at baccarat and eke <i>petits chevaux</i>;</p>
<p>And still the maidens flocked around, and vowed he was amusing 'em;</p>
<p>And borrowed five-franc pieces, just for fear he should be losing 'em;</p>
<p class="i2">And then he'd sandwiches and bocks, which brought on bad dyspep-</p>
<p class="i2">-sia for Lionel beloved by Damsels of Dieppe.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>As bees will swarm around a hive, the maids of <i>La belle France</i></p>
<p>Went mad about our Lionel and thirsted for his glance;</p>
<p>In short they were reduced unto a state of used-up coffee lees</p>
<p>By this mild, melancholic, maudlin, mournful Mephistopheles.</p>
<p class="i2">He rallied them in French, in which he had the gift of rep-</p>
<p class="i2">-artee, and sunnily they smiled, the Damsels of Dieppe.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>At last one day he had to go; they came upon the pier;</p>
<p>The French girls sobbed, "<i>Mon cher!</i>" and then the English sighed, "My dear!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span></p>
<p>He looked at all the threatening waves, and cried, the while embracing 'em,</p>
<p>(I mean the girls, not waves,) "Oh no! I don't feel quite like facing 'em!"</p>
<p class="i2">And all the young things murmured, "Stay, and you will find sweet rep-</p>
<p class="i2">aration for the folks at home in Damsels of Dieppe."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And day by day, and year by year, whene'er he sought the sea,</p>
<p>The waves were running mountains high, the wind was blowing free.</p>
<p>At last he died, and o'er his bier his sweethearts sang doxology,</p>
<p>And vowed they saw his ghost, which came from dabbling in psychology.</p>
<p class="i2">And to this hour that spook is seen upon the pier. If scep-</p>
<p class="i2">tical, ask ancient ladies, once the Damsels of Dieppe.</p>

<h2>VENEZIA LA BELLA</h2>

<p class="center1c">[According to a correspondent of the <i>Times</i>, it is proposed
to erect bridges connecting Venice with the mainland.]</p>

<p>One afternoon in the autumn of 1930, when the
express from Milan arrived at Venice an Englishman
stepped out, handed his luggage ticket to a
porter, and said, "<i>Hotel Tiziano</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>Adesso Hotel Moderno, signore</i>," remarked the
porter.</p>

<p>"They've changed the name, I suppose. All
right. <i>Hotel Moderno, gondola.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Che cosa, signore?</i>" asked the porter, apparently
confused, "<i>gon&mdash;, gondo&mdash;, non capisco. Hotel
Moderno, non è vero?</i>" And he led the way to
the outside, where the Englishman perceived a
wide, asphalted street. "<i>Ecco là, signore, la stazione
sotterranea del Tubo dei Quattro Soldi; ecco qui la
tramvia elettrica, e l'omnibus dell' hotel.</i>"</p>

<p>"<i>Gondola</i>," repeated the Englishman. The porter
stared at him again. Then he shook his head and
answered, "<i>Non capisco, signore, non parlo inglese</i>."
So the Englishman entered the motor omnibus,
started at once, for there were no other travellers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
and in a few minutes arrived at the hotel, designed
by an American architect and fifteen stories in
height. The gorgeous marble and alabaster
entrance-hall was entirely deserted.</p>

<p>Having engaged a room, the Englishman asked
for a guide. The hall porter, who spoke ten languages
fluently and simultaneously, murmured
some words into a telephone, and almost immediately
a dapper little man presented himself with
an obsequious bow.</p>

<p>"I want to go round the principal buildings," said
the Englishman. "You speak English, of course."</p>

<p>"Secure, sir," answered the guide, with another
bow; "alls the ciceronians speaks her fine language,
but her speak I as one English. Lets us go to
visit the Grand Central Station of the Tube."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said the Englishman, "not that sort
of thing! I'm not an engineer. I should like to
see the Doge's Palace."</p>

<p>"Lo, sir! The Palace is now the <i>Stazione Centrale
Elettrica</i>."</p>

<p>"Then it's no good going to see that. I will go
to St. Mark's."</p>

<p>"San Marco is shutted, sir. The <i>vibrazione</i> of
the elettrical mechanism has done fall the mosaics.
The to visit is become too periculous."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! Well, we can go up the Grand
Canal."</p>

<p>"The <i>Canal Grande</i>, sir, is now the <i>Via Marconi</i>.
Is all changed, and covered, as all the olds canals of
Venezia, with arches of steel and a street of <i>asfalto</i>.
Is fine, fine, <i>è bella, bella, una via maravigliosa"!</i></p>

<p>"You don't mean to say there isn't a canal left?
Where are the gondolas then?"</p>

<p>"<i>An, una gondola!</i> The sir is <i>archeologo</i>. <i>Ebbene!</i>
We shalls go to the <i>Museo</i>. There she shall see
one gondola, much curious, and old, ah, so old!"</p>

<p>"Not a canal, not a gondola&mdash;except in the
museum! What is there to see?"</p>

<p>"There is much, sir. There is the Tube of the
Four Halfpennies, <i>tutto all' inglese</i>, as at London.
He is on the arches of steel below the news streets.
There is the bridge from the city to Murano, one
span of steel all covered of stone much thin, as the
<i>Ponte della Torre</i>, the Bridge of the Tower, at
London. Is marvellous, the our bridge! Is one
bridge, and not of less not appear to be one bridge,
but one castle of the middle age in the middle
air. <i>È bellissimo, e anche tutto all' inglese.</i> And
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span></p>

<p>"Stop," cried the Englishman. "Does anybody
ever come to your city now? Any artists, for
instance?"</p>

<p>"Ah, no, sir! <i>Pittori, scultori, perche?</i> But
there are voyagers some time. The month past
all the Society of the Engineers of Japan are
comed, and the hotels were fulls, and all those sirs
were much contenteds and sayed the city was
marvellous. She shall go now, sir, to visit the
bridge?"</p>

<p>"No," said the Englishman, emphatically, "not
I! Let me pay my bill here and your fee, whatever
it is, and take me back to the railway station as fast
as you can. There are plenty of bridges in London.
I am going back there."</p>

<h2>WHAT TOURISTS NOTE</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>Supplementary Facts&mdash;omitted from the Times List</i>)</p>

<p>That everything is so much better on the Continent.</p>

<p>That the proverbially polite Frenchman never
smokes before ladies in a railway carriage.</p>

<p>That not for worlds would he shut the window in
your face and glare at you if you ask for a little air.</p>

<p>That no official ever seen through a pigeon-hole
at a post bureau is dyspeptic and insolent.</p>

<p>That sanitary improvements in Italy do not
mean typhoid fever.</p>

<p>That where your bed-room walls are of paper,
and somebody on one side of you retires in good
spirits at two, and somebody else on the other gets
up lively at four, you have a refreshing night's rest.</p>

<p>That rambling parties of Cook's tourists add
immensely to the national <i>prestige</i>.</p>

<p>That the discovery of what it is you eat in a <i>vol-au-vent</i>
at a "<i>diner à trois francs</i>," will please but
not surprise you.</p>

<p>That it is such fun being caged-up in a railway
waiting-room, and then being allowed to scamper
for your life to the carriages.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span></p>

<p>That perpetual fighting to get into over-crowded
hotels, crammed with vulgar specimens of your
own fellow-countrymen, is really enjoyable and
exhilarating work.</p>

<p>That a couple of journeys across the Channel,
especially if it is blowing both ways, are at least
always something pleasant to look back upon.</p>

<p>That when you once get home again, England,
spite some trivial advantages, being without Belgian
postmen, French omnibuses, and Swiss police-regulations,
strikes you as almost unendurable.</p>

<h2>MRS. R. ON BOULOGNE-SUR-MER</h2>

<p>Mrs. Ramsbotham, who
has been staying at Boulogne
for a short time, writes as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;"><a href="images/i_076-500.png"><img src="images/i_076-250.png" width="250" height="312" alt="" /></a></div>

<p>"Bullown-some-Air is, I
am informed, not what it
used to be, though the
smells must be pretty much
as always, which is not the
scent of rheumatic spices. It's called Bullown-some-Air
because if the sea-breeze wasn't too powerful
for the smells, living would be impossible. Many
of the visitors to the hotels on the Key told me the
bedrooms were full of musketeers, who came in
when the candle went out, and bit them all over.
Such a sight as one poor gentleman was! He
reminded me of the Spotted Nobleman at the
Agrarian in Westminster. Then, on the Sunday I
was there, a day as I had always been given to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>
understand the French were 'tray gay,' there was
actually no music, no band, no concert, and in fact
no amusement whatever at the <i>Establishmong day
Bangs</i> (so called because there's a shooting-gallery
next it, where they bang away all day at so much
a head), which might as well have been closed, as
there was no race-game (of which I had heard so
much), no Tom Bowling<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a class="ask" href="#footnote1"><sup>*</sup></a> (they wouldn't get up a
Tom Bowling unless there were nine persons
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>
present, which Mr. Hackson says is much the
same as when magistrates meet and there isn't
a sufficient number to make a jorum), and only
one gentleman trying to produce another to play
billiards with him.</p>

<p>"There was a theatre open. Not being a
Samaritan myself, though as strict as anyone as
to my own regular religious diversions at church,
I let Mr. Hackson take myself and Lavinia to see
<i>The Clogs of Cornwall</i>, which, I think, was the
name of the opera, though, as I hadn't a bill, and
didn't understand one quarter of what they were
saying&mdash;not but what I was annoyed by Lavvy
and Mr. Hackson always turning round to explain
the jokes to me&mdash;I confess I did not see what
either <i>Cornwall</i> or <i>Clogs</i> had to do with the story.
The singing and the acting was worse than anything
I'd ever met with at an English seaside
theatre, because a place like Bullown ought to
have a theatre as good as the one at Brighton.
The customs worn by the actors were ugly, and
when the lover, who was intended for a sailor&mdash;though
his dress wasn't at all <i>de rigger</i>&mdash;said, confidentially,
to the audience, alluding to an unfortunately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
 plain young person who played the part
of the Herring, "She is lovely!" there was a loud
laugh, or, as Mr. Hackson, who speaks French
perfectly, called it, a <i>levy de reedo</i>, all over the
house, and this emulating from people who, I
always thought, were remarkable for their politeness,
was about the rudest thing I ever heard done
to a public character in a playhouse.</p>

<p>"The place was hot, and the seats uncomfortable;
so that after two acts, which was more like being
in a penitentiary than a place of recrimination, we
left, and went to our hotel, where, there being
nothing more to do than there was anywhere else,
Lavinia and myself retired to rest&mdash;that is, such
rest as the musketeers would allow us. She slept
in a back cupboard, called a <i>cabinet de Twilight</i>,
because it was so dark and scarcely any veneration,
there being no fireplace, and only such a window,
as it was healthier to keep shut than open: but
she had the advantage over me in not being
troubled by any musketeers. There was only one
of them in my room, and when I heard him singing
away like a couple of gnats, I hid under the bedclothes,
and he couldn't find me till I came up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>
again for air, like a fish, and then he bit me on the
forehead.</p>

<p>"Next morning we went to breakfast '<i>à la four
sheets</i>' they call it, on account of the size of the
table-napkins, at the <i>Rest-wrongs</i> on the pier. The
time they kept us! as there was only one <i>gossoon</i>
to about twenty persons. The best thing we had
there was our own appetite, which we brought
with us.</p>

<p>"After this there was nothing doing in the place
till dinner-time (called <i>table doat</i> because they're
so fond of it), and after that there was a dull concert
at the <i>Establishmong</i>, and as Mr. Hackson
told us, who went there, a dull dance and poor
fireworks at the Artillery Gardens in the <i>Oat Veal</i>.
The '<i>Oat Veal</i>' is French for the high part of the
town, but, judging from the smells on and about
the Key, I should say that our hotel was situated
in quite the highest part of the town.</p>

<p>"Less than a week at Bullown was quite enough
and too much for us. If Sunday here were only
lively, it would be a nice change from London, or
Dover, or Folkestone, or Ramsgate, as I do not
know a pleasanter and easier way to go than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>
starting by the London, Chatting and Dover train at
10 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> from Victoria or Holborn Viaduct, arriving
at Dover at twelve. Then by one of the comfortablest
boats I was ever in, called the <i>Inflicter</i> or
<i>Invigorator</i>, I couldn't catch which, but Mr. Hackson
told me it was Latin for 'unconquered,' which
takes you, if it's a fine day and wind and tide
favourable, in an hour and a quarter to Callous (or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>
Kally in French), and if you are only going on to
Bullown, you have your luggage examined (as if
you were a smuggling brigadier!), and you have
more than an hour for lunch before you start again.
The luncheon at the Kallyous buffy is excellent,
and the buffers, who speak English with hardly any
accident, are most attentive. Then, when you've
finished, you start for Bullown by the 2.45 train,
and are at your hotel by 3.30 or thereabouts, which
is what I call doing it uxuriously.</p>

<p>"But Bullown, as Mr. Hackson said to me,
requires some <i>ongterprenner</i>, which means 'an
undertaker,' to look after it, as it has become so
deadly-lively. I think this must be a joke of
Mr. Hackson's, one of his <i>caramboles</i>, as they call
them in French, as what Bullown wants is waking
up. As it is now, Bullown is a second-class place,
and will soon be a third-class one, which, as Mr.
Hackson says, 'Arry and an inferior dummy-mong
will have all to themselves.</p>

<h2><i>IN RE</i> THE RIGI</h2>

<p>From a recent letter in the <i>Times</i> it would seem
that tourists visiting the hotels on the Rigi have to
secure entertainment at the point (or rather the
knuckle) of the fist. If the fashion is permitted to
become chronic (by the patient endurance of the
British public), the diary kept by the visitor to the
Rigi is likely to appear in the following form:&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tuesday</i>, 4 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Just seen the sun rise. Rather
cloudy in the valley, but on the whole magnificent.
Will stay until to-morrow, as I am sure the air is
excellent.</p>

<p>5 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Going back to the hotel. The night
porter is shouting at me.</p>

<p>8 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Just finished a three hours' fight with
the night porter. He scored "first blood" to my
"first knock-down blow." I was able to polish
him off in forty-seven rounds, and consequently
have an excellent appetite for breakfast.</p>

<p>9 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;After some desperate struggling with
half-a-dozen waiters, have secured a cup of coffee
and a small plate of cold meat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span></p>

<p>12 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>&mdash;Have been asleep on a bench outside
the hotel for the last two hours and a half, recovering
from my recent exertions.</p>

<p>1 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Have fraternised with five English
tourists armed with alpenstocks. One of our party
has opened negotiations with the hotel-keeper as
to the possibility of obtaining some lunch.</p>

<p>2 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Our ambassador has returned with his
coat torn into tatters, and one of his eyes severely
bruised.</p>

<p>3 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;By a <i>coup de main</i> we have seized the
<i>salle-à-manger</i>, and now are feasting merrily on
bread and honey.</p>

<p>4 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Just driven from our vantage-ground by
eight boots, ten waiters, the landlord and auxiliaries
from the kitchen.</p>

<p>6 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Have spent the last two hours in consultation.</p>

<p>7 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;A spy from our party (assuming the
character of an English duke) is just leaving us for
the front.</p>

<p>8 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Our spy has just returned, and reports
that when he asked for a room the enemy attacked
him with brooms and candlesticks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span></p>

<p>9 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Have just matured our plan of attack.</p>

<p>10 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>&mdash;Glorious news! A triumphant victory!
Our party, in single file, made a descent upon the
<i>table-d'hôte</i>, seized a large number of <i>hors d'&oelig;uvres</i>,
and, after an hour's desperate fighting, secured a
large room on the top floor, where we are now
safely barricaded for the night! Hurrah!</p>

<hr />

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">At Dieppe.</span>&mdash;<i>Edwin.</i> Awfully jolly here!

<p class="ind"><i>Angelina.</i> Quite too awfully nice!</p>

<p class="ind"><i>Edwin.</i> Waltz over. Awfully nice moon!

<h2>THEN AND NOW</h2>

<p class="title1"><i>Before the Holidays</i> (<i>an Anticipation</i>)</p>

<p>Really nothing so pleasant as packing. Such
fun to see how many things you can get into a
portmanteau. Won't take any books as the "Continong"
will be enough for amusement.</p>

<p>Capital carriages to Dover. Everything first-rate.
Civil guards. Time-table not a dead letter.
Splendid boats, smooth sea, and a first-rate <i>buffet</i>
at Calais.</p>

<p>Dear Paris! Just the place for the inside of a
week. Boulevards full of novelties. Theatres in
full swing. Evenings outside the <i>cafés</i> perfect
happiness. Splendid!</p>

<p><i>En route.</i> Swiss scenery, as ever, lovely. Mountains
glorious, passes, lakes. Delightful. Nothing
can compare with a jaunt through the land of Tell.</p>

<p>Italy&mdash;dear old Italy. Oh, the blue sky and the
<i>tables d'hôte!</i> What more glorious than the ruins
of Rome? What more precious than the pictures
of Florence? What more restful than the gondolas
of Venice?</p>

<p>And the people even! The French the pink of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>
politeness. The Swiss homely and kindly. The
Italians inheriting the nobility of the Cæsars.</p>

<p>And all this to take the place of hard work.
Well, it is to come. Bless everybody!</p>

<p class="title1"><i>After the Holidays</i> (<i>a Retrospect</i>)</p>

<p>What can be worse than packing? And after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>
all the trouble of shoving things in anywhere, you
find you have left half your belongings behind! And
of course the books you half read during your
weary travels are stopped at the Custom House.</p>

<p>Beastly journey from Paris to Calais, and as for
the crossing afterwards&mdash;well, as long as I live I
shall never forget it!</p>

<p>Dear Paris! Emphatically "dear," with the
accent on the expense. Glad to be out of it.
Boulevards deserted. Theatres playing "<i>relâche</i>."
<i>Cafés</i> deathtraps in the service of the influenza.</p>

<p><i>En route!</i> Who cares for Switzerland&mdash;always
the same! Eternal mountains&mdash;yet coming up promising
year after year! Sloppy passes, misty views.
Beastly monotonous. The Cantons played out.</p>

<p>Italy! Who says Italy? Blue sky not equal
to Wandsworth. Rome unhealthy. Art treasures
at Florence not equal to collection in South Kensington.
Mosquitoes at Venice.</p>

<p>And the people! Cheeky French, swindling
Swiss, and dirty Italians!</p>

<p>And yet this is all to be supplemented by the
same hard work. In the collar again. Oh! hang
everybody!</p>

<h2>ADVICE TO ENGLISHMEN ABROAD</h2>

<p>Excepting for their money, English tourists
are perhaps not highly valued on the Continent.
We would therefore offer a few practical suggestions,
which, now that the tourist season has
returned, will be found, no doubt, invaluable to
Britons when abroad:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;When you begin inspecting a foreign town
or city, it is wise to stalk along the middle of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>
streets, and make facetious comments on
whatever you think funny.
Laugh loudly at queer names which you see
above shop-windows, especially if their
owners, as is frequently the case, are lounging
by the doorposts.</p>

<p>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;When you go into a church, strut and stare
about as though you were examining a picture
exhibition. Display contemptuous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>
 pity for the worshippers assembled, and
make in a loud voice whatever critical remarks
you happen to think proper.</p>

<p>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;If, while you take your walks abroad, you
encounter an unfledged and enthusiastic traveller,
who daringly attempts to enter into conversation
with you, do your best to snub him in recital of
his exploits, and render him dissatisfied with his
most active feats. Interrupt his narrative with
pitying exclamations, such as "Ah, I see! you
went by the wrong route;" or, "O, then you <i>just</i>
missed <i>the</i> very finest point of view." You may
discover, very likely, he has seen much more than
you have: but by judicious reticence you may
conceal this awkward secret, and render him well-nigh
as discontented as yourself.</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;When you are forced to start upon some mountain
expedition, let everybody learn what an early
bird you are, and awaken them to take a lively
interest in your movements. Stamp about your
room in your very thickest boots, and, if you have a
friend who sleeps a few doors off, keep bellowing
down the passage at the tiptop of your voice, although
there may be invalids in plenty within earshot.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span></p>

<p>5. &nbsp;&nbsp;Should you gallantly be acting as a <i>courrier
des dames</i>, mind that your lady friends are called
an hour sooner than they need to be. A pleasant
agitation will be thus caused near their bedrooms.
They will amuse those sleeping next them with an
incessant small talk, and, as their maid will be dispatched
on endless little errands, their door will be
heard creaking and banging-to incessantly until
they clatter downstairs.</p>

<p>6. &nbsp;&nbsp;When you come into a drawing-room or <i>salon
de lecture</i>, make your triumphal entry with all the
noise you can, so as to attract the general attention.
Keep your hat upon your head and glare
fiercely at the quiet people who are reading, as
though, like Gessler, you expected them to kneel
down and pay homage to it.</p>

<p>7. &nbsp;&nbsp;Should your neighbour at the <i>table d'hôte</i>
attempt to broach a conversation with you, turn
your deaf ear, if you have one, to his insolent
intrusion. If in kindliness of spirit he will still
persist in talking, freeze the current of his speech
by your iciness of manner, or else awe him into
silence by your majesty of bearing.</p>

<p>8. &nbsp;&nbsp;If, despite your English efforts to remain an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>
island, you find yourself invaded by aggressive foes
to silence, strive to awe them by the mention of
your friend Lord Snobley, or of any other nobleman
with whom you may by accident have ever
come in contact. For aught they care to know,
you may be his Lordship's hairdresser; but the
title of a lord is always pleasant hearing in the
company of Britons, although benighted foreigners
have not such respect for it.</p>

<p>9. &nbsp;&nbsp;Never give yourself the trouble to order wine
beforehand for the <i>table d'hôte</i>, but growl and
grumble savagely at waiters for not bringing it
the instant you <i>have</i> ordered it, even though you
happen to have entered the room late, and find a
hundred people waiting to be served before you.</p>

<p>10. &nbsp;&nbsp;In all hotels where service is included in the
bill, be sure you always give a something extra to
the servants. This leads them to expect it as a
thing of course, and to be insolent to those who
can't so well afford to give it.</p>

<h2>ROUNDABOUT READINGS</h2>

<p>Ostend must be a glorious place. From an
advertisement which has appeared in an evening
contemporary I gather that "the multitude, anxious
to spend an elegant and fashionable sojourn in the
country, has rendered itself this year at Ostend.
It is a long time since such an opulent clientele
has been united in a seaside resort. At the fall of
day the vast terraces of the fashionable restaurants,
situated along the sea-bank, present a fairy aspect.
There is quite a confusion of dazzling costumes
upon which sparkle thousand gems, and all this
handsome cosmopolitan society passes through the
saloons of the Kursaal Club, in which one hears
spoken all known languages as at Babel and Monte
Carlo, and of which the attractions are identical to
those of the latter place." This is the first time I
have heard of a similarity to Babel being mentioned
as an attraction. But no doubt an opulent
clientele has peculiar tastes of its own, especially
when its dazzling costumes sparkle with thousand
gems.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span></p>

<p>In a small Belgian town (naturally not Ostend)
I once saw the following notice hung over the door
of a washerwoman's establishment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width18">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Anglish linge tooke here from 1 sou</p>
<p>Shert, cols, soaks, sleep-shert, pokets.</p>
<p class="i10">I eet my hatt.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>The last sentence puzzled me for a long time.
Finally I came to the conclusion that it was not
intended so much to be a statement of actual fact
as an enticement to English people, who would of
course take all their washing to a lady commanding
so gay and accurate a knowledge of an English
catch-phrase.</p>

<hr />

<p>My third example of English as she is spoke is
from a notice issued by an out-of-the-way hotel in
Italy, which had changed its management:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The nobles and noblesses traveller are beg to tell
that the direction of this splendid hotel have bettered
himself. And the strangers will also find high
comforting luxuries, hot cold water coffee bath and
all things of perfect establishment and at prices
fixed. Table d'hôte best of Italy France everywere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
Onclean linens is quick wash and every journals is
buy for readers. Beds hard or soaft at the taste of
traveller. Soaps everywere plenty. Very cheaper
than other hotel. No mosquits no parrot no rat."</p>

<h2>TONGUES FOR TOURISTS</h2>

<p>The Long Vacation is drawing to a close, and
parents and guardians may like to know how
reading tours have aided in advancing the education
of their respective scions. Should any doting
fathers be interested in the absorption of foreign
languages into their sons' systems, the following
mems from the diary of a University man, who
has just returned from a tour abroad, whither he
had gone expressly to perfect himself in European
tongues, may be productive of some reflection.</p>

<p class="rindent2"><i>July.</i></p>

<p>Left Dover for our tour. Met American Colonel
X. Y. Zachary at Calais. Glorious brick. Knew
French, and talked for us all. Gave us quite a
twang, and left us devoted to Yankees.</p>

<p>Put up at Grand Hotel. English waiter. Saved
us lots of trouble. Went to English tavern. Excellent
beefsteak for dinner. Cheese direct from
Cheshire. Went to open-air music hall in the
Shongs Eliza, what they call a coffee concert.
Two English clowns and a man who sang
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>
"<i>Tommy, make Room for your Uncle.</i>" English
family on both sides of us. Dropped their H's
freely. Met two college chums in the yard of the
Grand when we came back.</p>

<p>Went out to buy German Dictionary, French
Grammar, and Italian Dialogues. Bought a copy
of <i>Punch</i> instead&mdash;great fun.</p>

<p>Started for Italy. Capital guard with the train:
knew English thoroughly. Queen's messenger in
the carriage; splendid linguist. What's the use of
trying to speak a foreign language, if you don't
begin in your cradle!</p>

<p>Arrived at Turin. Met the Larkspur girls at
the station. Went everywhere with them. They
are all awfully jolly. Quite gorgeous at slang.
Must buy that Italian Grammar and Dialogues.
Learnt the Italian for "Yes" to-day.</p>

<p>On to Venice. How well our gondolier talks
English. Lovely weather for cricket or lawn
tennis. Nothing so jolly here. Old bricks, and
dirty punts they call gondowlers.</p>

<p class="rindent2"><i>August.</i></p>

<p>Start for Rome. Fancy a Roman train. What
was it? All Gaul, or all the train, was divided <i>in</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>
<i>tres partes</i>. Sang comic songs all the way. Bother
Rome! it reminds one of Virgil and Horace, and
all those nuisances. By the way, we must not
forget the Italian Dialogues. Hotel commissioner,
such a good fellow. Has lived in the Langham
for the last six years. Told us a capital American
story. Left the others to go round the monuments
while I played a game of billiards with Captain
Crawley. By Jingo! he does play well. <i>He</i> never
learnt Italian or French, but I have heard he is a
Greek. Speaks English like a Briton.</p>

<p>Meant to have begun Italian to-day; but too hot,
really. Go back by Vienna and Trieste. Better
buy a German Dictionary. Charlie's voice downstairs,
by Jove! Hurrah! Off to Vienna. Go
over the Tyrol by night. Sleep all the way.</p>

<p>Vienna. Awfully good beer. English parson
in same hotel. Knows the governor. Wants me
to take him round, and as he hears I am studying
German, will I interpret for him? See him further
first.</p>

<p class="rindent2"><i>September.</i></p>

<p>Leave Vienna, to escape parson. The German
tongue most attractive when made into sausages.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg 124]</span>
Lingo simply horrible. Couldn't learn it if I
tried.</p>

<p>Arrived at Munich. Drove round the English
Garden. Nothing English in it except weeds and
ourselves. Saw <i>Richard the Third</i> played at the
theatre. Call that Shakspeare? Well! I am
particularly etcetrad. And in German, too! Why
don't they learn English?</p>

<p>Home in time for some partridges. By the way,
wonder what became of the "coach" who went
out with me? Never bought the grammars and
dictionaries, after all. There's nothing like English
if you want to be understood.</p>

<hr />

<p class="ind1"><span class="sc">At Baden-Baden.</span>&mdash;<i>Captain Rook.</i> Yes, my
dear sir, although they have closed the Public
Tables, still, if you really want a little amusement,
I think I can introduce you to a very good set

<h2>FLORENCE IN THE FUTURE</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>A very distant Future, let us hope</i>)</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> Can you speak English?</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> Yes, sir. I lived in London for many
years.</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> It is a very long time since I was in
Florence. What is there to see in your city now?</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> The city has been entirely improved, sir.
There is the new Palazzo Municipale. It is superb.</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> I don't think I should care for that.
What else is there?</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> There are the new Boulevards, the Piazza
Umberto and the Ponte Nuovo. They are all
magnificent, and the American visitors admire
them very much. So do the English visitors,
but there are very few of them. It is curious,
for Florence has been made quite new and
handsome.</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> I don't wish to see new buildings. Isn't
there anything old?</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> Oh, yes, sir, of course. There is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg 128]</span>
Piazzo Vittorio Emmanuele. That is more than
thirty years old.</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> I remember the hideous square. But
where are the old buildings? How about the
Baptistery?</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> Oh, that was pulled down six years ago
to make more room for the tramways. It was a
dark, ugly old place. There is a beautiful new
Battistero now, made of glass and iron, like the
Crystal Palace near London, put up in place of the
old Cathedral which nobody liked.</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> What? You don't mean to say Giotto's
Tower has gone?</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> There was some old <i>campanile</i>. I think
it was sold to the Hawaii Territory World's Fair
Syndicate.</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> Anyhow, there's the Ponte Vecchio.</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> Oh, yes, sir. But nobody goes to see
that. It was pulled down a great many years ago,
and some old-fashioned, artistic Florentines made
a great fuss, so it was put up again on dry land at
the end of the Cascine. The Municipality used to
do that years ago. Pull down an old building, and
put it up again in quite a different place, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg 130]</span>
say it was just the same. It hardly seemed worth
the trouble. Happily they did not put up a
memorial to every old building, as the English did
to Temple Bar. As for the Ponte Vecchio, it was
turned into a switchback railway at last, but it
never paid. There is the Ponte Nuovo&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> No, thank you. But look here. There
must be something. Where are the pictures?</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> They were taken to Rome, sir, when the
Palazzo Pitti and the Palazzo degli Uffizi were
pulled down.</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> How about statues? I remember old
statues everywhere, and some vile modern ones.</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> Yes, sir, years ago, but the old ones were
all cleared away to make more room for the electric
tramways. But there's a magnificent statue of
Italy on the Piazza at Fiesole. The figure is two
hundred feet high, made of cast iron, painted to
look like marble. She holds an electric light in her
hand, which you can see at night from miles away.</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> But I'd rather not. How about the
churches? Where is Santa Maria Novella?</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> Excuse me, sir; Santa Maria Novellissima.
There was an old church once, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg 131]</span>
present one is quite new. It is made of steel, with
thin stone stuck all over it, to look like a stone
building, just like the Tower Bridge in London.
You know, sir, we get many artistic ideas from
England. It is a very clever imitation, and much
admired.</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> No doubt. I'll ask you one final question.
Which is the oldest building now standing
in Florence?</p>

<p><i>Guide.</i> Well, really, sir, I'm not quite sure. I
should think the gasometer on the left bank of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg 132]</span>
Arno is about as old as anything. The Stazione
Centrale was very ancient, but of course the new
Railway Station&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Tourist.</i> That'll do. I arrived at that station
this morning. You take me back there, and I'll
leave this unhappy place for ever. I'm off to
Turin. It may be a rectangular, monotonous city,
but it's now the oldest town in Italy.</p>

Perhaps you might give me your view
of the subject. The suggestions of fresh minds
are frequently very valuable. I have noticed that
you have been pondering over something for the
last half-hour. You were thinking, perhaps, that
greater liberty might be given to the framers of

<p>Is it asking too great a favour to beg you to lend
me the keys of your boxes? A hundred thousand
thanks.</p>

<p>Your explanation is absolutely satisfactory. You
are bringing these sixteen unopened boxes of
cigars home for your grandmother. It is a most
proper thing to do, and, under the circumstances,
the duty will be remitted.</p>

<p>And these three hundred yards of lace of
various makes and ages? An heir-loom! Indeed!
Then, of course, the packet must pass
duty-free.</p>

<p>As we have found nothing of consequence in this
portmanteau of yours, it will be unnecessary to
search the nineteen boxes of that gracious lady,
your wife. No doubt she has obeyed your instruction
not to smuggle. We are absolutely
satisfied with your explanations, and are greatly
obliged to you for your kindness and condescension.</p>

<p>This is the way to the carriage. We have placed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg 140]</span>
steps before the door, as without
a platform it is difficult to ascend.</p>

<p>No, mein herr, it is utterly impossible?
We are forbidden by the Emperor
himself to accept a gratuity.</p>

<p>Yes, madam, it is indeed without charge.
Do not tempt us. Instant dismissal
is the penalty.</p>

<p>Certainly, mein herr, you could get the same politeness before the
Emperor issued his Imperial instructions.</p>

<p>But then the charge was a thaler!</p>

<h2>INTO SPAIN</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>With a Conversation-Book</i>)</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/i_141-430.png"><img src="images/i_141-200.png" width="200" height="309" alt="Into Spain" /></a></div>

<p><i>Cannes.</i>&mdash;Read that the
weather is dismal and cloudy
in England. Shall stay in the
sunny South a little longer.
Cannes is a charming place.
But might as well see something
different. Where to go?
Consult map. Good idea. Spain.
Consult time-tables. Easiest
thing in the world. Tarascon
to Barcelona. What is there to see in Barcelona?
Nuts probably. Also Spanish manners and customs,
dark eyes, fans, <i>mantillas</i>, and so forth.
Shall certainly go, after a few days. Good idea
to learn a few words of Spanish. Must be very
easy. Italian and French mixed, with some Latin
added. Amiable Frenchman in hotel supports this
view. He says, airily, "<i>Vous quittez Paris dans</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg 142]</span>
<i>le 'sleeping,' vous achetez des journaux espagnols
à Irun, et, arrivé à Madrid vous parlez espagnol.</i>"
Cannot hope to rival that linguistic feat, but may
be able to learn a few phrases between Cannes and
Barcelona. Buy a conversation-book in French
and Spanish.</p>

<p><i>Port Bou.</i>&mdash;Across the frontier. Custom-house
station. Now is the time to begin Spanish. Have
read some of that conversation-book on the way.
Begin to doubt its utility. Usual sort of thing.
"Has thy brother bought a boot-jack?" "I wish
these six volumes of Molière's plays to be bound
in half calf." And so forth. This one is the same,
only in French.</p>

<p>Custom-house officer, in beautiful uniform and
bright green gloves, very strict in his examination
of my luggage. The green gloves travel all over
my property, and bring out a small cardboard
box. Triumphant expression on official's face.
He has caught me. Open box, and show him it
contains a few white ties. His face now shows
only doubt and amazement. Cannot explain to
him verbally. Evidently useless to mention the
binding of Molière's plays. The green gloves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg 143]</span>
beckon another custom-house officer, also wearing
bright green gloves. Together they examine my
harmless white ties. It seems to me the green
gloved hands are held up in pious horror. Try
them in French, in Italian, in English. No good.
Should perhaps tip them in Spanish. But why
waste <i>pesetas</i>? So refrain. They shake their
heads still more suspiciously. The only thing
remaining for me to do is to ask if the brother
of one of them has bought a boot-jack. Does not
seem very appropriate, but, if said politely, might
imply that I wish to change the subject. Am just
about to begin the note of interrogation upside
down, which gives such an uncanny air to a
Spanish question, when they cease looking at my
ties, and I pass on.</p>

<p><i>Barcelona.</i>&mdash;Shall have no difficulty here. Have
been told that French is spoken everywhere. If
not, then English or Italian. Everyone in the
hotel speaks French. To the bank. Manager
speaks English beautifully. Buy some cigarettes.
Old woman in the shop speaks Italian. Shall
get on capitally. Need not trouble to carry the
conversation-book in my pocket.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg 144]</span></p>

<p>In the evening to the opera. Walk out between
the acts, seeing Spaniards also walking out, and
enter a café. Order coffee. Waiter brings a huge
glass of water, and a cup, filled to the brim with
sugar, on which the <i>verseur</i> is about to pour my
drink. Stop him. Explain in French that I take
no sugar. The two, and another waiter, stand
round me, with dazed faces. By Jove, they speak
only Spanish! Wish I had the conversation-book.
But should probably have found something like
"<i>Nous ne voulons pas faire une excursion en mer, parce
qu'il fait trop de vent</i>," or "<i>Ces bottines sont un peu
étroites, veuillez les élargir</i>." No good trying talking.
Turn out eight or ten lumps of sugar, and so
get my coffee. Then return to the opera. Four
polite officials at the entrance gaze wonderingly at
the counterfoil of my ticket, which I concluded
served for readmission, no pass ticket being offered.
Ask each one, in turn, if he speaks French. He
does not. Oh for the conversation-book! If only
I could say "<i>Tous les tableaux dans le Salon Carré
du Louvre sont des chefs-d'&oelig;uvre</i>," or "<i>Est-ce que
mademoiselle votre s&oelig;ur joue du piano?</i>" I should
have shown myself to be an individual with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg 146]</span>
innocent and refined tastes, and not a socialist
or a brigand. The second phrase would
have been singularly appropriate in the opera
house. Alas, I cannot! So address them in
French, with bows and smiles.
And they respond in Spanish, evidently
with great courtesy, also with bows and
smiles, and let me pass in, probably
because they cannot make me understand
that I ought to stop out. For the
future I must carry that conversation-book
everywhere.</p>

<h2>HOLIDAY HINTS</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>By the Expert Wrinkler</i>)</p>

<p>Where to spend Saturday to Monday is, of
course, the prevailing and stubborn problem in
many of the stately homes of England. What
then must be the difficulty when the question to be
answered is where to spend the Easter holidays?
The reply depends, of course, very much upon the
time that can be expended upon the vacation. If,
to take an example, a gentleman has only a week
at his disposal, it is little use his thinking very
seriously of India or the Cape; but Paris is, of course,
well within his power. Given a fortnight he might
get as far as Rome if he wished to, although for my
part I prefer Monte. On this favourite resort,
however, I need not dwell at present, as my readers
will remember a paragraph on Monte and suitable
costume there which I wrote some two or three
years ago on the occasion of one of the infrequent
breakings of the bank.</p>

<h2><span class="sc">The Ideal Equipment</span></h2>

<p>Any gentleman who really wishes to acquire a
reputation as a citizen of the world must be supplied
with a large number of travelling outfits which he
can pack at a moment's notice. A compendious
bag fitted with requirements for the moors is
always handy under my bed; and I am ready
to start for the Riviera, the Normandy coast,
Paris, Switzerland, the Bavarian Alps, the Rhine,
Norway, Palestine, Iceland, at ten minutes' notice,
according as the invitation may be worded. No
gentleman at all in demand can afford to dispense
with such preparations. But to make travel really
pleasant, remember that you must not only do
in Rome as Rome does, but you must dress as
Rome (or Paris) expects you to.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">The Needs of Paris</span></h4>

<p>Paris being the favourite Easter resort, I cannot
do better, even at the risk of repeating myself, than
give a few hints as to costume in the gay city. A
strong light suit of tweed dittoes, of a pronounced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg 159]</span>
check pattern, should be the basis of one's wardrobe.
By way of headgear a deer-stalker, a cloth,
or best of all, a pith helmet, is <i>de rigueur</i> in the
English visitor, and if you are not provided by
Nature with side-whiskers and long projecting
front teeth, you must call in the resources of art to
make good these deficiencies.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">A Sensible Swiss Outfit</span></h4>

<p>For a Swiss tour I should recommend the following
outfit, A dome-shaped celluloid hat for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg 160]</span>
resisting the impact of avalanches; two climbing
suits of stout Welsh homespun or Irish frieze
(do not make the mistake of wounding the susceptibilities
of the local <i>fauna</i> by choosing chamois
leather, otherwise an excellent substance); hot-water
tube puttees and purpoise-hide brogues. A
good supply of alpenstocks and blue veils is indispensable.
For hotel life, I recommend tourists to
take their own mosquito curtains, a pianola, and a
portable swimming-bath. The changes of temperature
in Switzerland are so sudden that one
must be prepared for every emergency. If the
noontide glare has to be faced, bombazine bloomers
will be found most refreshing. But if the Matterhorn
is to be scaled by moonlight you cannot
be too warmly clad.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">National Costume</span></h4>

<p>What I would impress on any intending traveller,
then, is to be prepared within certain limits to
accommodate his dress to that of the country
he proposes to visit. It is quite a mistake to suppose
that this will involve any serious outlay.
Foreigners, though sensitive, are considerate, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg 162]</span>
will not expect strangers to adopt every detail of
their national costume. For instance, I have found
that the alterations needful for a visit to Vienna
are very few indeed. The absolute minimum is a
butterfly tie, but I should also recommend a bottle
of <i>pommade Hongroise</i> and a tall hat with a flat
brim. The ordinary brim can be made to lie flat
with a little coaxing, and can be curled up afterwards
by any good hatter. High heels also create
a favourable impression on the foreign mind, and if
you take a black coat be sure that it is heavily
braided.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">The Tyrol and Italy.</span></h4>

<p>I knew a man who said that you would
be welcomed anywhere in the Tyrol if you
could only jodel. Personally, though I think that
a little <i>tul-lul-liety</i>! may be a passport to the affections
of the Tyrolese peasant, it has no influence
whatever with hotel-keepers. For Italy, a velvet
or velveteen coat will make you feel at home, and
if this should prove beyond the resources of your
purse, then I strongly recommend earrings as the
irreducible minimum. The preliminary operation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg 164]</span>
I admit, is a little painful, but it soon passes
off. Earrings, with a red Garibaldi shirt and
a Byron tie, give a man a very stylish and thoroughly
peninsular appearance.</p>

<h2>FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h2>

<p>There is no doubt that
one's first impressions are
always the brightest and
the best; therefore I resolve
to record the first
impressions of a first visit
to the Italian lakes.</p>

<p>"<i>British Bellagio</i>,"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hôtel Victoria, Prince de
Galles et des Iles Britanniques," or some such name,
is usually, as <i>Baedeke</i>r says, "frequented by
the English." They are here certainly, and one
hears one's native language everywhere. There
are the honeymoon couples, silent and reserved,
who glare fiercely at anyone who might be supposed
to imagine for a moment that they are
newly married; there are people who converse in
low monotonous voices about the weather, which
changes every hour; there is an old lady, who
gives one startling information, telling one, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg 173]</span>
instance, that Paul Veronese was born at Verona;
and there are two or three British menservants,
gazing with superb disdain at the poor foreigners.
The hotel is very quiet. The evening of a week-day
is like Sunday evening, and Sunday evening
is&mdash;&mdash;!!! If only the weather were not also
English, or even worse. On the last day of September
the only warm place is by the fire in the
<i>fumoir</i>. So let us hurry off from this wintry
climate to somewhere, to anywhere. By the first
boat we go.</p>

<p>Still English everywhere. At Bellagio a great
crowd, and heaps of luggage. At Cadenabbia a
greater crowd, and more heaps of luggage. Here
they come, struggling along the gangway in the
wind. There is a sad-faced Englishman, his hands
full of packages, his pockets stuffed with others,
carrying under his arm a little old picture wrapped
loosely in pink tissue paper, which the wind blows
here and there. He is a forgetful man, for he
wanders to and fro collecting his possessions.
With him is another forgetful Englishman in very
shabby clothes, who also carries packages in
paper, and who drags after him an immensely fat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg 174]</span>
bull-dog at the end of a cord five yards long,
which winds round posts and human legs and
other obstacles. At last they are all on board&mdash;the
forgetful Englishmen have darted back for
the last time to fetch in an ice-axe and an old
umbrella&mdash;and on we go over the grey water, past
the grey hills, under the grey sky, towards Como.
At Cernobbio the shabby Englishman lands,
dragging his bull-dog at the end of the cord, and
carrying in his arms two rolls of rugs, a bag, and
other trifles. His sad-faced companion, still
holding his tiny Old Master in the ever-diminishing
pink paper, wanders in and out seeking forgotten
treasures, an ice-axe, a bag, another paper parcel.
Finally all are landed, the gangway is withdrawn,
the steamer begins to move. Suddenly there is a
shout. The shabby Englishman has forgotten
something. The sympathetic passengers look
round. There is a solitary umbrella on a seat
No doubt that is his. A friendly stranger cries,
"Is this yours?" and tosses it to him on the quay.
Then there is another shout. "<i>Ach Himmel</i>, dat
is mine!" The frantic German waves his arms,
the umbrella is tossed back, he catches it and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg 176]</span>
happy. But meanwhile another English man, the
most egregious ass that ever lived, has discovered
yet another solitary umbrella, which he casts wildly
into space. For one moment the captain, the
passengers, the people on the quay, gaze breathless
as it whirls through the air. It falls just
short of the landing-stage, and sinks into the grey
waters of that chilly lake, never more to be
recovered, in any sense of the word. In those
immeasurable depths its neat silk covering will
decay, its slender frame will fall to pieces. It has
gone for ever. Beneath this grey Italian sky some
Italian gamp must keep off these Italian showers.
Then the captain, the passengers, and the people
smile and laugh. I, who write this, am the only
one on whose face there is not a grin, for that
umbrella was mine.</p>

<blockquote><p>["On the other hand, however, we must avow some apprehension
that too minute attention to the possibility of cheap
travel may render a Continental tour a continual vexation
and trouble. Plain living and high thinking are, as Mr.
Capper says, crying wants of these days; but the latter
condition is hardly to be attained by the self-imposed
necessity of striking a bargain with a landlord at the end of

chairs and a sliding bureau. Can't. Begin a letter
to the <i>Times</i> in my head.</p>

fashions.</p>

<p class="ind2">Evian-les-Bains&mdash;and may the waters be worthy
of their reputation.</p>

<p class="ind2">Florence&mdash;and may the pictures soothe the
irritation caused by an indifferent <i>table d'hôte</i>.</p>

<p class="ind2">Genoa&mdash;and may the view wash away the recollection
of Italian uncleanliness.</p>

<p class="ind2">Heidelberg&mdash;and may the popular ruins survive
the vulgarity of the personally conducted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg 190]</span></p>

getting to it.</p>
